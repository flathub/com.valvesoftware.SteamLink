    1.    Grant of Licenses.

       A. Personal Use Limited Installation License. Valve hereby grants, and by installing the Program you thereby accept, a limited, non-exclusive license and right to install copies of the Program on each of your computers solely for your personal use. 
         
       B.    Restrictions/Reservation of Rights.  Except as expressly set forth elsewhere in this License Agreement, you may not, in whole or in part: copy, photocopy, reproduce, translate, reverse engineer (with the exception of specific circumstances where such act is permitted by law), derive source code from, modify, disassemble, decompile, or create derivative works based on the Program; remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Program; or attempt in any manner to circumvent any security measures designed to control access to the Program. You may not package the Program with, or pre-install the Program on, any hardware, without obtaining a separate license from us.  The Program is licensed to you as a single product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than one computer.  You may not sell, grant a security interest in, rent, lease or license the Program to others without the prior written consent of Valve. The Program is licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Program or copies thereof.
    
    2.      Ownership. All title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Program and any and all copies thereof (including but not limited to any titles, computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialog, catch phrases, locations, concepts, artwork, animations, sounds, musical compositions, audio-visual effects, methods of operation, moral rights, and any related documentation) are owned by Valve or its licensors.  The Program is protected by the copyright laws of the United States, international copyright treaties and conventions and other laws. All rights are reserved. The Program contains certain licensed materials and Valve's licensors may protect their rights in the event of any violation of this Agreement.

    3.     Termination. This License Agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate the License Agreement at any time by destroying the Program.  We may terminate your rights set forth in Section 1 of this License Agreement at any time by disabling the functionality of the Program.  This License Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event that you fail to comply with the terms and conditions contained herein. In such event, you must immediately destroy the Program.  The provisions of Sections 2, 3, and 5-7 will survive any termination of the Agreement.  

    4.     Export Controls. The Program may not be re-exported, downloaded or otherwise exported into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods, or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders.

DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THE STEAM AGREEMENT, AND/OR ELSEWHERE IN THE STEAM AGREEMENT, APPLY TO YOUR USE OF THE PROGRAM.  AS NOTED IN THE STEAM AGREEMENT, FOR EU CUSTOMERS, SUCH PROVISIONS DO NOT REDUCE YOUR MANDATORY CONSUMERS' RIGHTS UNDER THE LAWS OF YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTION.

    6.    Miscellaneous. Provisions relating to applicable law and jurisdiction, and dispute resolution, set forth in the Steam Agreement shall apply to any disputes arising under this Agreement.  This License Agreement and the Steam Agreement terms incorporated herein may be amended, altered or modified at any time by Valve in Valve's sole discretion. In the event that any provision of this License Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining portions of this License Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This License Agreement and the Steam Agreement constitute and contain the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior oral or written agreements.
You hereby acknowledge that you have read and understand the foregoing License Agreement and agree that the action of installing the Program is an acknowledgment of your agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of the License Agreement contained herein, including the Steam Agreement.
